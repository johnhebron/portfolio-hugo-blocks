_Excerpt from the Computerworld article:_

"**10. Hire great customer reps, support them and give them some flexibility.**"

“If you've hired correctly, you've got a team of talented, trustworthy individuals waiting to serve your customers,” says John Hebron, a technical support trainer at Bigcommerce. “Having to get manager approval for every small thing wastes their time, the manager’s time and the customers’ time.” So “give them the ability to do what's right without having to always ask permission,” he advises. Though be sure to set limits beforehand to avoid potentially costly problems."
